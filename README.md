# AI Call Management Automation System

Production-grade AI-driven call automation system built using n8n, Twilio, APIs, and ReqBin for testing and validation.

This system automates inbound and outbound call workflows, decision routing, and API-triggered call logic with reliability and error handling.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional call handling systems are rigid, manual, and lack intelligence.

This project demonstrates how **AI + workflow orchestration + telecom APIs** can transform call operations into intelligent, scalable automation pipelines.

---

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

- Automated outbound call triggering
- Intelligent call flow routing
- API-driven call execution
- Webhook-based orchestration
- Request testing & validation using ReqBin
- Structured retries and failure handling
- Event-based workflow triggering

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

**Trigger → API → n8n → Twilio → Call Flow → Response → Logging & Retry Layer**

Components:
- n8n (Workflow Engine)
- Twilio Programmable Voice API
- REST APIs
- ReqBin (API testing & debugging)
- Webhooks

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- n8n (Orchestration)
- Twilio Voice API
- REST APIs
- Webhooks
- ReqBin
- JSON-based logic routing

---

## ⚙ Workflow Logic

1. External trigger / API request
2. Validation & preprocessing
3. Call initiation using Twilio
4. Dynamic flow control
5. Error handling + retries
6. Event logging & monitoring

---

## 🧪 API Testing & Debugging

ReqBin is used for:
- Endpoint testing
- Payload debugging
- Request validation
- Response inspection
- Workflow simulation

---

## 📌 Use Cases
